The story is about Satan seeking to conquer the world of Ente Isla, but when confronted by the Hero Emilia, he is forced to retreat through a gate that transports him to modern day Tokyo, Japan. To survive and find a way to return to Ente Isla, Satan adopts the name Sadao Maou and gains part-time employment at a fast food restaurant called MgRonald\'s, a parody of McDonald\'s. There have been two manga adaptations published by ASCII Media Works in Dengeki Daioh and Dengeki Maoh.
